<h1> About

 

</h1>

 

<p> Hi! My name is Jessica Willmes and I am a Kindergarten Teacher at Model Laboratory Elementary School. I am hoping this website will serve as a 
 way to support our students and families by providing more information about our reading resources as well as learning opportunities throughout our county as well. 
 Please check back often so you can learn more about our family engagment activities we have planned for our upcoming school year!  
 Included on this page are pictures of a few of our students at our family engagement events.<br>
